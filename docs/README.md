# Cyclic Cellular Automata

## Background

[Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) are models that simulate discrete mathematical concepts applied to a grid of cells. Each cell has a state, and each step of the program compares cells' states relative to each other in order to determine the next state for each cell.

[Cyclic Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_cellular_automaton) simulate a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" form of neighbor mutation. If a neighbor has a higher value than another cell, then the lower neighbor's value will become the higher neighbor's value. But if a cell with the lowest possible value is next to a cell with the highest possible value, then the higher cell's state will become the lowest value.
